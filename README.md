# Faithful x64 – Tech Reborn (Work in Progress)

This texture pack is still in a very early stage of development. Currently, only selected textures from Tech Reborn have been reworked and brought up to the visual standard of the Faithful x64 style. The goal is to consistently transfer the aesthetics of the original Faithful project to the content of the Tech Reborn mod without losing its characteristic design features.

## Credits

The following resources and projects served as a basis:

- Faithful x64 Resource Pack
Individual textures were adapted in compliance with the respective license terms or used as a style reference. The basis is the original Faithful x64 project (current maintainer/project team according to official sources).

- Tech Reborn Mod
Original textures and visual design elements of the mod were used as a reference and inspiration. Some were recreated based on these in the Faithful style.

All modified or newly created textures have been manually reworked and are not unmodified copies. Should the project development progress further, additional credits will be added, especially if external contributors, tools or other basic resources are added.
